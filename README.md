# Dummy-Video-Player-AndroidApp
It's a basic video player app made for practicing of concepts learned and is a part of [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/SiddharthaBhattacharjee/100Days-of-Code).<br>
The app uses mediaPlayer Class, SurfaceView seekbar and some buttons to play videos and as of now can't access device media (plays only default videos).<br>

This app is made for practicing of concept and is not intended for any largescale or commercial distribution.
